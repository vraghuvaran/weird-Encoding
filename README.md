# weird-Encoding
```
Encoding represents an Image.But how?
```
This is one of challenges given in a CTF<br/>

# Solution
 
 Given a text which represents an image. <br/>
 Here the thing is to find out the flag which can be found when we convert the text into an image(The text itself represents an image format)
 
 ```
0x85+1x1+0x14

```
Here a bit of observation was required to figure out that the “x” symbol mean concatenation n number of a character, like 0x5 will mean 00000. And “+” would mean concatenation of two strings of different type. Also, one will also have to decide on 0 representing 255 255 255 i.e. the color white and 1 representing 0 0 0 , i.e. the color black. You could have experimented with both combinations but eventually you would get the correct mapping.<br/>
```
$ python solve.py 
```
it will print a neat ascii art on the stdout <br/>
